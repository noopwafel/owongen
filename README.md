This is a hacky script I wrote to talk over USB to the AG2052F in my local hackerspace (revspace),
because I couldn't find anything else which did it.

It's not complete nor completely tested, but hope it helps someone!

Someday it might make sense to integrate it into https://github.com/Galvant/InstrumentKit
